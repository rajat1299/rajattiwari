I'm obsessed with the aesthetics of platforms like Cosmos and Pinterest—places that make curating feel effortless and beautiful. This is my personal digital garden: a visual portfolio inspired by that same spirit of curation, where I collect projects, thoughts, inspirations, and everything in between.

## About This Site

This portfolio is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring:
- **Masonry grid layout** for visual storytelling
- **Dark/light theme** toggle
- **Space-based organization** (Everything, Spaces views)
- **MyMind-inspired aesthetic** with smooth animations and card interactions
- **Responsive design** that adapts beautifully across devices

## Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CSS columns for masonry layout
- KaTeX for mathematical notation rendering
- Python server for local development

## Local Development

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## Design Philosophy

This site embodies a few core principles:
- **Visual density over whitespace** - Every scroll should reveal something new
- **Curation as craft** - What you choose to show matters as much as how you show it
- **Beauty in function** - Aesthetics and usability aren't mutually exclusive
